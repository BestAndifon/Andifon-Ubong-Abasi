Project Background: The AgricSwift modelling project is about predicting the farm produce loss pattern or trend to see the rate at which farmers' commodities or food produce were wasted. 
Dataset:Link To Dataset:: https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-data/en/  The dataset was a loss trend on some farm produce based on reports from FAO. It consisted of the commodity, loss percentage, activity, and food supply stage.
Activity: Cleaned, visualized, and interpreted the dataset. After reviewing the visuals, we built a model that can predict the patterns of losses in the future, enabling us to know how best to tackle produce losses and introduce key features on our online platform to mitigate the challenge. Using linear regression, we predicted the loss pattern for farm produce in the long run. The scatter plot indicated a constant loss rate in the farm produce over the years. In order to test the efficiency and reliability of our model, we employed the R-squared metric. For a model to be desirable, the independent variable should predict a certain proportion of the variability of the dependent variable (0<R2<1). According to our results, the model employed does not provide any predictive value (-0.09)
