👋 Hi there! I'm Andifon Ubong-Abasi, a passionate data analyst with a knack for turning raw data into actionable insights. I've honed my skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling to help organizations make informed decisions.

🎓 I graduated with a degree in Library and Information Science from University of Uyo and from there i started learning data analysis through platforms like Tech4Dev, Udemy, Nsonye and Cousera where I developed a solid foundation in data science principles and techniques. Since then, I've been immersed in various data-centric projects, where I've leveraged my expertise in SQL, Python, PowerBI, Excel and other tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

🔍 Whether it's uncovering trends, predicting outcomes, or optimizing processes, I thrive on the challenge of solving real-world problems with data. From exploratory data analysis to developing machine learning models, I enjoy every step of the analytical journey.

📊 In this GitHub repository, you'll find a collection of my data analysis projects, each showcasing my approach to tackling different problems and extracting valuable insights. From analyzing customer behavior to predicting sales trends, I'm constantly exploring new datasets and methodologies to expand my skills and knowledge.

🌟 I'm always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, collaborate on projects, or simply chat about all things data science.
